# RustFront
My first Rust WebApp using Yew 
### Conclusions
Its not really worth writting a frontend with Rust. Since it is slower than vanilla javascript anyways.
The only situations that I see worth using rust is when you NEED to embed an application that meet the following requirements:
1) Heavy Weighted
2) CPU intensive
3) GPU? intenisve
4) You will compile it to WebAssembly
Examples:
Videogames
Fully featured apps like Photoshop, Blender, Adobe After Effects.
